				For a good chunk of the United Kingdom's history, the choice of a royal spouse and the country they hailed
				from
				was a matter of critical national importance for a British monarch.

			<p>For this island nation, choosing the right spouse was key to building or maintaining vital political
				alliances
				with Continental powers. Conversely, marrying the wrong person, without a proper dowry or royal
				connections,
				could weaken the legitimacy of the royal lineage and encourage dissent. </p>

			<p>Where did these (mostly) women come from? And do their places of origin reveal historic trends? </p>
			<br>
			<p>Let's find out, using <a href="https://github.com/mfhan/project1/">data analysis</a> and visualization.
			</p>


			<p>(Note: this timeline starts with the House of Normandy (1066) and ends with the
				current House of Windsor, a time span of more than 860 years. Records from the Houses of Wessex and
				Denmark
				(886-1066) are too complex and unreliable,
				with dates lost to time and uncrowned consorts of uncertain status.
				Our analysis starts with the Norman Conquest and ends with Queen Camilla.)</p>

					From the get-go, we notice countries bunched together, succeeding themselves. There's a long series of
					French-born consorts (blue bars) during the first third of the series, a gaggle of English-born spouses
					(pink)
					in the middle, and a spate of Germans (orange) in the final quarter.
				</p>

				<p>Several trends are visible: <br>

					-- There are no fewer than <strong>10 French women</strong> (blue bars) among the first 15
					consorts, and 13 among the first 20. <br>

					-- But after that number, there is a <strong>shift toward English queens</strong> (pink bars).<br>
					-- And further down the list, a series of <strong>six German consorts</strong> including Albert of Saxe Coburg
					and Gotha.

				<h3 class="subtitle">Looking for a French Spouse</h3>
				<p>For most of the middle ages, from 1066 to around 1470, securing a French spouse was the best way
					for English sovereigns to maintain familial connections with France, with which it was
					competing
					for a staggering number of territories.</p>
				<p>Most famously, <strong>Eleanor of Aquitaine</strong> in 1154 brought with her a duchy that was larger
					than the
					kingom of France at the time.</p>
				<p>In 1170, <strong>Margaret of France</strong> was picked because her dowry was the much disputed
					territory of
					Vexin north of Paris.</p>

				<divright>

					<p class="source" text-align="right">Henrietta of France, wife of Charles I</p>
				</divright>

				<p><strong>Catherine of Valois'</strong> marriage to <strong>Henry V</strong> in 1420 was part of a plan
					to
					eventually place her husband on the throne of France, and thereby end the Hundred Years' War. </p>
				<p>When Yorkist <strong>King Edward IV</strong> secretly wed widowed commoner <strong>Elizabeth
						Woodville</strong> in 1464, his relationship with his allies never recovered and more dynastic
					bloodshed ensued.</p>
				<p>Two centuries later, <strong>Catherine of Braganza</strong> was picked for <strong>Charles II</strong>
					in 1660
					after her father became the head of Portugal's colonial empire -- and she offered an opportunity for an
					alliance
					between the two kingdoms.</p>

				<p>Once the United Kingdom adopted a constitutional regime that severely curtailed the monarch's powers,
					the
					international importance of a consort diminished.</p>
				<p>Of course, royal spouses still had to meet strigents requirements; when young <strong>Queen Victoria</strong>
					married Albert, a minor German prince, opposition parties
					refused to
					grant him a British peerage.</p>
				<p><strong>Queen Alexandra's</strong> family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father
					became king
					of Denmark. She was then deemed an appropriate wife for the future <strong>Edward VII</strong>, son of
					Queen
					Victoria.</p>
				<p><strong>Edward VIII</strong> found out when he resolved to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson --
					but the
					monarch's choice of a consort ceased to be a matter of vital <strong>international</strong> importance.

					Given France's front-runner status in the number of British consorts it produced, its dominant position
					in cumulative tenure time shouldn't be a shock. Still, it is striking that England, with no fewer than
					10
					consorts, doesn't even reach the 100 year mark and is actually beaten by Germany. </p>
				<p>This low total tenure time posted by English consorts clearly illustrates that, for most of history,
					royal
					marriages were above all a diplomatic tool aimed at securing the country's international standing in an
					always insecure world.
