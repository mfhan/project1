      <h3>For most of the United Kingdom's history, Jane Austen's opening remark in <i>Pride and Prejudice
        </i> was a matter of critical national importance for a British monarch.

        <p> Choosing the right spouse was key to building or maintaining vital
          political alliances with Continental powers. Conversely, marrying the wrong person could weaken the legitimacy

        <p>Catherine of Valois' marriage to Henry V in 1420 was part of a plan to eventually place his husband on the
          throne of France, and thereby end the Hundred Years' War.

          head of the powerful Portuguese colonial empire.
        <p> Alexandra of Denmark's family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father was chosen to become
          king of Denmark. She was then deemed an appropriate wife for the future Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria.

        the
        House of Windsor. Records from the Houses of Wessex and Denmak (886-1066) are too complex and unreliable,
        with dates lost to time and uncrowned consorts of uncertain status.
        Our analysis starts with the Norman Conquest and ends with Queen Camilla.

<fn>"Hainaut and its neighbourhood remained an important frontier area, or "march", during the High Middle Ages. Though
  it was part of the Holy Roman Empire, which ruled from what is now Germany, it was culturally and linguistically
  French and part of the Catholic Archdiocese of Reims. Like its neighbours such as the counties of Brabant and
  Flanders, it was frequently entangled in the politics of France." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Hainaut</fn>
