      <h3>For most of the United Kingdom's history, Jane Austen's opening remark in <i>Pride and Prejudice
        </i> was a matter of critical national importance for a British monarch.


        <p>For this island nation, choosing the right spouse was key to building or maintaining vital political
          alliances with Continental powers: often, those countries were France, Spain and Germany.
        <p>Conversely, marrying the wrong person, without a proper dowry or royal connections, could weaken the
          legitimacy
          of the royal lineage and encourage dissent. </p>
        <p>Where did these (mostly) women come from? And do their places of origin reveal historic trends? Will the data
          show anything unexpected?
        <p>Let's find out, using data analysis and visualization.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Note:</strong> this timeline starts with the House of Normandy (1066) and ends with the
          current House of Windsor, a timespan of more than 860 years. Records from the Houses of Wessex and Denmark
          (886-1066) are too complex and unreliable,
          with dates lost to time and uncrowned consorts of uncertain status.
          Our analysis starts with the Norman Conquest and ends with Queen Camilla.

        <p>From the get-go, we notice countries bunched together, succeeding themselves. There's a series of
          French-born
          consorts (blue dots) during the first third of the series, a gaggle of English-born spouses (lime green) in
          the middle, and a spate of Germans (yellow) in the final quarter. </p>

      <h4>
        <p>The stacked bar chart summarizes nicely the political and military imperatives behind the choice of women
          from
          the same country, over and over.
        <p>For most of the middle ages, from 1066 to around 1470, securing a French spouse was the best way for English
          sovereigns to maintain familial connections with the Kingdom of France, with which it was competing for a
          staggering number of territories.

          <!-- <img src="./img/maryteck.png" alt="Henrietta of France, wife of Charles I" height="280" width="250"

          <!-- <img src="./img/EleanorProvence.jpg" alt="Eleanor of Provence" height="250" width="180"
          class="align-left medium" /> -->
        <p>Most famously, Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154 brought with her a duchy that was larger than the kingom of
          France
          at the time.
        <p>In 1170, Margaret of France was picked because her dowry was the much disputed territory of Vexin north of
          Paris.
        <p>Catherine of Valois' marriage to Henry V in 1420 was part of a plan to eventually place his husband on the
          throne of France, and thereby end the Hundred Years' War.

        <p>Catherine of Braganza was picked for Charles II in 1660 after her father became the head of Portugal's
          powerful
          colonial empire.
          <img src="./img/Camilla.jpg" alt="queen Camilla" height="250" width="180" class="align-left medium" />
        <p> Alexandra of Denmark's family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father became king of
          Denmark. She was then deemed an appropriate wife for the future Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria.

        <p>But with the end of the 19th century, the international importance of a consort diminished. Of course, royal
          spouses had to meet the social requirements of their time, but the monarch's choice of a consort ceased to be
          a matter of vital international importance.

          <h4>Being a royal spouse can be a lifelong mission (as evidenced by the very pink column on the penultimate
            spot -- that's Prince Philip, who stayed at his post for 69 years) or evaporate in an instant: many women,
            even queens, died in labor, and as shown by the sobering flat entries next to the green Spanish column in
            the middle of the chart, made the mistake of marrying King Henry VIII to tragic results.

              consorts, doesn't even reach the 100 year mark and is actually beaten by Germany.
              <p>At the same time, the low total time posted by English consorts only strengthens our thesis: that for
                most of history, royal
                marriages were above all a diplomatic tool aimed at securing the country's international standing in an
                ever insecure world.
