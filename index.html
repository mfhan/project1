        <p>With apologies to Jane Austen's opening remark in
          <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, for a good chunk of the United Kingdom's history, the choice of a spouse was a matter of
          critical national importance for a British monarch.
      </div>

      <p>For this island nation, choosing the right spouse was key to building or maintaining vital political alliances with Continental powers.

      <p>Conversely, marrying the wrong person, without a proper dowry or royal connections, could weaken the legitimacy
        of the royal lineage and encourage dissent. </p>

      <p>Where did these (mostly) women come from? And do their places of origin reveal historic trends? Will the data
        show anything unexpected?
        <br>
      <p>Let's find out, using <a href="https://github.com/mfhan/project1/">data analysis</a> and visualization.
        <br>

      </p>(Note: this timeline starts with the House of Normandy (1066) and ends with the
      current House of Windsor, a timespan of more than 860 years. Records from the Houses of Wessex and Denmark
      (886-1066) are too complex and unreliable,
      with dates lost to time and uncrowned consorts of uncertain status.
      Our analysis starts with the Norman Conquest and ends with Queen Camilla.)

      <p>From the get-go, we notice countries bunched together, succeeding themselves. There's a series of
        French-born
        consorts (blue dots) during the first third of the series, a gaggle of English-born spouses (lime green) in
        the middle, and a spate of Germans (yellow) in the final quarter.
      <p>Let's try with another chart.

        -- There are no fewer than <strong>10 French women </strong>>(blue bars) among the first 15

      <p>The stacked bar chart summarizes nicely the political and military imperatives behind the choice of women
        from the same country, over and over.

      <p>For most of the middle ages, from 1066 to around 1470, securing a French spouse was the best way for English
        sovereigns to maintain familial connections with the Kingdom of France, with which it was competing for a
        staggering number of territories.

        <!-- <img src="./img/maryteck.png" alt="Henrietta of France, wife of Charles I" height="280" width="250"

        <!-- <img src="./img/EleanorProvence.jpg" alt="Eleanor of Provence" height="250" width="180"
          class="align-left medium" /> -->
      <p>Most famously, <strong>Eleanor of Aquitaine</strong> in 1154 brought with her a duchy that was larger than the kingom of
        France
        at the time.
      <p>In 1170, <strong>Margaret of France</strong> was picked because her dowry was the much disputed territory of Vexin north of
        Paris.
      <p><strong>Catherine of Valois'</strong> marriage to <strong>Henry V</strong> in 1420 was part of a plan to eventually place her husband on the
        throne of France, and thereby end the Hundred Years' War.

        <img src="./img/Camilla.jpg" alt="queen Camilla" height="250" width="180" class="align-left medium" />
      <p>When Yorkist <strong>King Edward IV</strong> secretly wed penniless commoner <strong>Elizabeth Woodville</strong> in 1464, his relationship with
        his allies never recovered and more dynastic bloodshed ensued.
      <p>Two centuries later, <strong>Catherine of Braganza</strong> was picked for <strong>Charles II</strong> in 1660 after her father became the head of Portugal's colonial empire -- and she offered an opportunity for an alliance between the two kingdoms.
        <p>Once the United Kingdom adopted a constitutional regime that severely curtailed the moanrch's powers, the international importance of a consort diminished.
  
      <!-- <p>Of course, royal
        spouses had to meet the social requirements of their time. <p>When young <strong>Queen Victoria</strong> married Albert, a minor German prince, opposition parties refused to grant him a
          British peerage.
        <p><strong>Queen Alexandra's</strong> family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father became king of Denmark. She
          was then deemed an appropriate wife for the future <strong>Edward VII</strong>, son of Queen Victoria.
         <strong>Edward VIII</strong> found out when he resolved to marry
        American divorcee Wallis Simpson -- but the monarch's choice of a consort ceased to be a matter of vital
      <strong>international</strong> importance. -->

      We've taken a close look at the composition and sequence of British royal marriages, but could there be a

        <p>Being a royal spouse can be a lifelong mission (as evidenced by the very pink column on the penultimate
          spot -- that's <strong>Prince Philip</strong>, who stayed at his post for 69 years) or evaporate in an instant: many women,
          even queens, died in labor, and as shown by the sobering flat entries next to the green Spanish column in
          the middle of the chart, made the mistake of marrying King <strong>Henry VIII</strong> to tragic results.

        <p>Given France's front-runner status in the number of British consorts it produced, its dominant position
          in cumulative tenure time shouldn't be a shock. Still, it is striking that England, with no fewer than 10
          consorts, doesn't even reach the 100 year mark and is actually beaten by Germany.
        <p>At the same time, the low total time posted by English consorts only strengthens our thesis: that for
          most of history, royal
          marriages were above all a diplomatic tool aimed at securing the country's international standing in an
          ever insecure world.
