## The British Consort Conundrum: Data Collection and Visualization
### What I wanted to find out: 
I am from France, and a bit of a history buff. I was reading an umpteenth book about the Wars of the Roses (1399-1483) when it dawned on me that an awful number of English queens in the Middle Ages were anything but. In their vast majority, they had left their home coountry at a young age to marry an English monarch and represent that kingdom for the rest of their lives. I wanted to learn more about their birthplaces.  

### What I really found: 
-- a larger-than-expected number of English women (10) becoming consorts
-- but confirmation that, in terms of total tenure, they were dwarfed by non-English consorts 

### Summary of the data collection process, with links
-- Wikipedia, two different pages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_royal_consorts  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_royal_consorts) 
-- Personal research to collect birthplace info when not provided by Wikipedia

### Overview of the data analysis process
-- Data cleanup: appending several tables; bringing consistency to tables; simplifying entries; removing unnecessary columns. Tool: python. 

-- Data analysis: Grouping and averaging. 

-- Visualization: Used plotly, matplotlib, seaborn to explore options. Datawrapper for quick bar charts. 


### New skills & learning opportunities: 
I had to be patient with the process and at the same time decide to ditch unproductive dataset to pick up this topic on the fly. I learned to form clear questions to get the right kind of help from TAs. 

### What I tried to do but did not have the skills/time (but might do if I had more time)
-- I would have wanted to produce more sophisticated charts showing the composition of the consorts list every time a new spouse came in the picture. I intend to find a solution. 
-- I would like to get comments from actual historians about royal marriages and receive input on more interesting angles to explore.
