## The British Consort Conundrum: Data Collection and Visualization
### What I wanted to find out: 

### What I really found: 

### Summary of the data collection process, with links


### Overview of the data analysis process


### What new skills, approaches, etc I used, or where I grew the most during the project


### What I tried to do but did not have the skills/time (but might do if I had more time)


-- Data used for analysis

-- Notebooks used for data collection and analysis

-- Your notebooks should include some Markdown cells at the top that explain what you're doing in the notebook. Ideally you also sprinkle commentary/questions throughout the notebook.

-- A .gitignoreLinks to an external site. file to keep out any files you don't actually want in the project

-- A link to the project page (you can add a link in your README, or by clicking the gear icon next to "About" on the right-hand side of your repo)
